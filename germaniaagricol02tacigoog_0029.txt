Tacitus is decidedly superior to Livy. The characters ol Livy
are distinguishable only as classes—the good all very good.
the bad very bad, the indifferent very indifferent You dis·
cover no important differente between a Fabius and a Marcellus,

further thau it lies on the face os their actions. In Tacitus,
the characters are all individuals. Each stands out distinctly

Δ , from the surrounding multitude, and not only persorms his

own proper tectione, but is governed by his own peculiar

motives. Livy places belore us the statues of heroes and ,

gods; Tacitus conducis us through the crowd ol living men. 1
7Ιιι an attempt to sketch the most striking leatures ol Tacitus,

as a writer, no critic can omitto mention his sege and pithy

maxims. Apothegms abound on every page—sagacious, truth·

iul, and prosound in sentiment, in style concise, aritithetic and

sententious. Doubdess he is excessively fond os pointed
antithesis. Perhaps he is too much given to moralizing and
reflection. Itwaa,as we have said, the-faultoi his age. But
no one, who is familiar with Seneca, will severely censure
Tacitus. He will only wonder that he should have risen so
iar above the laults oi his contemporaries. Indead, Tacitus
interweaves his reflectione with samuch propriety, and clothes
his apothegms with so much dignity-he is so manifestly com·
petent to instruct the world by maxims, whether in civil, social,
or indi'ddual lise, that we are iar from wishing he had indulged
in it less. His reflectione do not interrupt the thread of his
narrative. They grow naturally out ol hls incidente. They
break forth spontaneously from the lips ol his men. His

’ history is indeed philosophy reaching byexamples3 and his

pithy sayings are truly lessous oi wisdom, embodied in the
lorm most likely to strike the attention, and impress the

memory. We should love to see a collection of apothegma
irem the peu oi Tacitus. It would melre an admirable book
