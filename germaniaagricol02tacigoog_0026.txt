Simple narrative n'o longer suited the pampered toste oi tha

plainness and precision would have been much better, aud ’

which may well surprise ns in a writer of so much conciseness.
Lord Monboddo, in a very able, though somewhat extravagant

name ol composition, but seem rather like the raw materials oi
history, than like history itseli (Orig. and Prog. ol Lang, vol
