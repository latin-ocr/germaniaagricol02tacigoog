AGRICOLA.

——0-0-0-—2—

rm Biography of Agricola was written early in tbs reign of Trajan
(which commenced A„ U. C. 851. A. D. 98), cenaequently about the
same time with the Germania, though perhaps somewhat later (ci.
notes on Germania). Thisdate is established by inferenoe from tha
' author’s own longuage in the ad and the cath sections (see notes)
In the former, he speaks os the dawn osa better day, which opened

hearing, thathc might live to see Trajan elevated to the imperial
throne-language very proper and courtly, if Trajan were already
Emperor, buta very awkwarn compliment to Nerva, ii, as many

Dima, with which deceased Emperors were usually honored And
irem the omission oi this epithet iu connection with the name oi
Nersa, together with the terma of honor in which Trajan ismen-
tioned, it is inferred that the picea was written in that briei period
ei three months, which intervened between the adoption oi 'l'rajan
by Nerva, and Nerva’s death (see Brotier and many others) But
