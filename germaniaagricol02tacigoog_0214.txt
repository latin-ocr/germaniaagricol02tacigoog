Harkness's Oaesar.

This edition os (laeenr'e Commentarios, intended to follow the Latin
Roader, aime to introduce the student to an appreciative etudy oi Latin
authors. The text is the result oi a careful collation of the several edi-
tions most approved by European scholare. 'l'he notes are intended to
guido the faithful efforts of the ieamer, and to furnich him such collateral
information as will enable him to understand the etirring events recorded
in the Oommeniaries, and such special aid as will enable hini to surmount
real difficulties of· construction and idiom. l'hey will ihus, it is hoped,
render an acceptable service both to the instructor and the ieamer, by
lightening the burden of the one, and by promoting the progress of the
other. The dictionary hus boen prepared with special reference to the
wants of the student.

'l'he Life oi Goeser, tho Map oi Gaul, and the diagrams and illustre·
tione which accompany the notes, will greatly add to the velue of the
work.
