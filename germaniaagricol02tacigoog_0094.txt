l'usTicatz'se Du Suc, Hormus rr Porcus omnum, was uiitlcu
(es appears from the trestise ilselt', see §dll in the second consulship
of the Emperor Trajan, A. U. G. 851, A. Ι). 98. The design of the
author inite publication has boen variously interpreted. From the
’ censure which it frequently posses upon the corruption sud degen-
erscy of the times, ithus been considered as a mere satire upon Ro·
man manners, in the ege of Tacitus. But tc say nothing ol the ill

adaptation of the whole plan to a satiricel work, there are large
parts of the treatire, which must have been'prepsred with great lae

bor, end yet can have no possible bearing on such a design. Satires
are not wontto sbound in historicel notices and geographical details
especially touching a foreign aud distant land

The seme objection lies against the political onds which have
been imputed to the author, such es the persuading os Trajan to en
gage, or aot tc engage, in a war with the Germane, as the most po
tent and dangerous enemy of Rome. For both these aime have been
alleged and we might content oursclves with placing the one es sn
offset against the other. But aeide from the neutralizing force of such ,
contradictione, wherefore such an imposlug erray of geographicel re
‚ search, of historical'lore, ol politicsl and moral philosophy, lor the
eccomplishment of so simple a purpose! And why is the purpose
so scrupulously concesled, that confessedly it ean be guthered oulv
from obscure intimations, and those os ambiguous importl Besidos
there are passages whose tendency must have becu oireotlr conules
to either of these alleged sirus (cs. note ξ 33).
