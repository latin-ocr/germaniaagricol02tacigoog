the application of the cpitlrct in question, was not a matter oa
necessity or of universal practice. lts omission in this case might
have bcen accidental, or might have proceeded from unknown rea·
sons And the bare absence of a single word surely cannot ba
entitled to much weight, iu compar-ison with the obvious and
almost necessary import of the passages just cited.

The primary object of the work is sufficiently obvious. lt was
to honor the memory of the writer's excellent father-indam Agricola
(eft 3: honori Agricolae, mei soceri, destinatus). So far from
, apologizing for writing the life of so near a friend he fecis assured
that his motives will be appreciated and his design approved, how·
ever imperfect may be its execution; and he deeius an apology necas
aary for having so long delayed the performance of that filiai duty.
After an introduction of singular beauty aud appropriateness (cf.
notes), he sketches a brief outline of the purentage, edumtion, and '
early life of Agricola but dravvs ont more at length the history of hi· ,
consulship aud command in Britain, of which the following snm·
mary, from Hume’s History of England, may not be unprofitable to

victorious arms northward3 defeated the Britons in every encounter,
pierced into the foresta and the mountains of Caledonia, reduced

every state to subjectior in the southern parts of the island, and ¹

chased before him all the menos fiercer and more intractable spirits,
who deemed war and death itself less intolerable than servitude
under the victora He defeated them in a decisive action which
they fought under Galgucus3 aud having fixed a chain of garrisous
between the frithsof Clyde and Forth,he cut off the ruder and mors

barren parts of the island and secured the Roman province from
tha incursione of the more barbarous inhabitants. During thess
military enterprises, he neglected not the arts of peace. He iutro-
duced laws and civility among the Britons; taught them to desire
and raise all the conveniences of life; reconciled them to the Ito·
man language and manners; instructed thern in letters and science;
aud employed every expedient to render those chains which
he had forged both easy and agreeable to them.” (His of Eng.
vol. 1.)

'l'he history of Agrimlu during this period is of course th« his·
tcry of Britain. Accordingly the author prefaces it with an outline
ol tha geographioal features, the situation, soil, climate, productione
