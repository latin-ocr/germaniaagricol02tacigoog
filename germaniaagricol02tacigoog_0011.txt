4. The department in which less remained to be done than .

any other, for the elucidation of Tacitus, was that of Geography.
History, and Archaeology. The copious notes of Gordon and
Murphy left little to be desired in this line; and these notes are
not only aocessihle to American scholare in their original forms,
but hare been incorporated, more or less, into all the college
editions. If any pecdliar merit attaches to this edition, in this
department, it will be found in the frequent references to such

to follow the German editions in dispensing entirely with diecti
