political end, but es he himself informs us (327), to treat of the ori
ginand manners, the geography and history, of the German Tribes
The same candor and sincerity, the same correctness and truthful

nese, which characteriae the Histories, mark also the work on Ger·
many. The author certainly aimed to speak the truth, and nothing

but the truth, on the subject of which he treats. Moreover, he had
abundant means of knowing the truth, on all tha main points, in the
character and history of the Germane. It has even been argued
from such expression aa cidissus (ξ 8), that Tacitus had himself been
in Germany, and could, therefore, write from persona] observation.
But the argument proceeds on a misinterpretation of his language
(cl note in loe. cit). And the use of accepimus (as in ἓ 27}
shows that he derived his information from others. But the Ro
mens had been in constant intercourse and connection, civil or.
military, with the Germana, for two hundred years. Germany fur·-
nished a wide theatra for their greatest commanders, and a fruitful
theme for their best authors, some of whom, ss Julius Cesar (ta
whom Tacitus particularly refers, 28). were themselves the chier
actore in what they relate. These authors, some of whose contribu-
tions to the history of Germany are now lost (e. g. the elder Pliny,
who wrote twenty books on the German warsl must have all been

in the hands of Tacitus, and were, doubtless, consulted by him; nol,
however, as a servile copyist, or mere compilet (for he sometimes
differs from his authorities, from Caesar even, whom he declares to
be the best of them), butas a discriminating and judicious inquirer.
The account of German customs and institutions may, therefore, be
relied on, from the intrinsie credibility of the author. It receives
confirmation, also, from its general accordance with other early aa·

counts of the Germane, and with their better known subsequent
history, as well as from its strong anslogy to the well-known habits
of our American aborigines and other tribes in a'like stage of cir·
ilization (cf note, ᾖ 15) The geographieal details are composed
with all the accuracy which the evershifting positione and relations
of warring and wandering tribes rendered possible in the nature ot
the case (cf. note, ὅ 28). In sentiment, the treatise is surpassingly
rich and instructive, like all the works of this prinae of philosophieal
historiens. In style, itis concise and nerrous, yet quite rhetorical,
and in parts, even poeticsl to a fault (see notes passim, cl also,
Monboddo’s critique on the style of Tacitus). “The work! says
La Bletterie, “is bn'ef without being superficial. within the cons·
