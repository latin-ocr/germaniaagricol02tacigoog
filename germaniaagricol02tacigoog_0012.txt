severity. The punctuationisthe result of adiligent comparisou -
of the best editions, together with a careful study of the con
nexion of language and of thought. ,

The German editions above mentioned, together with severa.
Freuch, English, and American werke, have not only been con·
stantly before me, but have been pseu with great frecdom, aud
credit awarded to them accordingly. Some may think their
names should have appeared less frequently ; others that they
should have received credit to a still greater extent. Suffica it
to say, 1 have never intended to quote the language‚ or borrow
the thoughts of an author, without giving his name; and in mnt-

I have not considered it needfnl, with German scrupulosrty‚ to
distinguish between my own references and those of others. lt

no references have been admitted on trust. They have been care·
fully verified, and it is hoped that numerous as the-y are, they
will be found pertinent and useful, whether illustrativc of things,
or of mere verbal usage. Some, who nse th.. noolr, will donbtless
find occasion to follow them out either in whole or in part; and
those who do not, will gain a general impressius as b) the sources
from which collateral informaticn may be obtained, that will bc
of no small value.

will show the estimatinn in whi'ch Ι hold them. Perhaps Ι have
used them too freely. My only apology is, that sofar as they
go, they are just what isowanted3 and if Ι had avoided using
them to a considerable extent, I must have substituted something
less perfect of my own. Had they been more copinas, and
extended more to verbal and grammatica] illustratione, thess
,Notes never would have appeared.

The editoris convinced, hom his experience as a teacher,
that the student of Tacitus will not master the difficulties, or
sppreciate the merite, of so peculiar an author, unless his
