Harkness's Elementa oi Latin Grammar.

'l'his work is intended especially for those who do not contemplate
ι collegiata course, but it may be successfully used in any school where,
for special reasons, a small grammar is deemed desireble. l'he beginner
needs tc store his mind ut the outset with the lens of the language in
such forms of statement as he can carry with him throughout his whole
course of study. 'l'he convenience and interest of the student in this
regerd heve been carefully consulted in the preparation of this manual.
All the paradigma, rules, and discussions, have been introduced in the
exact lauguage cf tho authcr’s Grammar, by which it may at any time ,
be supplemented While, therefore, in many schools thie work will be
found a sufficient Latin Grammar, it may be used in others, either es
preparatory tc the larger Grammar, or in connection with it.

No separate references to this volume will ever be needed in editione
of Latin authors, es the nurnbering of the articles is the same as iu the

larger Grammar.
