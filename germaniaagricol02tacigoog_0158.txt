Thcitus possessed poculiar advantuges for being the historian of tha
early Britons His father-inlaw was the first to subject the whole
islandia the sway of Rome. Hc traversed the country from south
to north at the head of his armies, explored it with his own eyes,
and reported what he saw to our author with his own lips. Hc
saw the Britons too, in their nati-ve nobleneas in their primitive lora ·
of liberty and virtue; before they had 'become the slaves oi Roman
arma the dupes of Roman arta, or the victims of Roman vices A few
paragraphs in the concise and nervous style of Tacitus, have made na
quite acquainted with the Britons, as Agricola found them; andan
the whole, we have nc reason to he oshamcd of the primaeval inhab-
