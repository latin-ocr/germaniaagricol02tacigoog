With Explanatory Notos. By llENRY S. Falsas, Professor oi
Latin in the State University oi liiehigan. Illustrated l2mo,
598 peges.

'l'he appearance oi this editiones Virgil's AEneid vill, itis believed,
be hailed with delight by all elassieal teaohers. Neither expense nor

pains have been spared to elothe the great Latin epia in a fitting dress. ’

The type is unusually large and distinet, and errore in the text, so an·

noying to the learner, have been earefully avoided. 'l'he work contains
eighty-five engravings, which detinente the neeges, costumas, aveapous
arte, and mythology oi the adolente vvith a vividness that ean be attained
only by pictorial illustratione. The great feature of this edition is the
scholarly and judieious commentary furnished in the appended Notes.
une author has here endeavored not to show his learning, but to supply
such praetleal aid as vill enable the pupii to understand and appreciate
. what he reads. The notes are just full enough, thoroughly explaining
the most diffleult passages, while they are not so extended as to take all
labor oii' the pupil’s hands. Properly used, they cannot fail to impert an
· intelligent acquaintance with the syntax of the language. In a word, this
work is commended to teaohers as the most elegant, accurate, interesting,
and praetiaally usesul edition oi the AEneid thathee yet been published.
