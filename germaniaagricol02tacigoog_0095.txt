The author does indeed, in the passage just cited, seem to uppre
ciete with almost prophetie accuracy, those dangers to the Roman
Empire, which were so searfully illustrated in ia subsequent fall be
neath the power of the German 'lbibes ; and he uttcrs, aa what true
Roman would not in such lorebcdings, the warniugs and the pray-
ers ol a patriot sage. But he does this only in episodes, which aro
so manifestly incidental, aud yet ariae so naturally out of the narra·
tivo or description, that it is trulysurprisiug it should ever have oc·
czurcd to any madar, to seek in them the key to the whole treatiso.

The entire warp and wool of the work is obviously histori-
ςαὶ and geographica. The satire, the politieal maxims, the moral
sentimenta, and all the restare merely incidental, interwoven for
the sake of instruction and embellishment, inwrought because a mind
so thougbtful aud so acute as that oi Tacitus could not leave them
out Tacitus had long been collecting the materiale for his Roman
Historias In so doing, his attention was necessarily drawn osten
and with special interest to a people‚ who, for two eeuturies aud
more, had been the most formidabis enemy cf the Roman State. In
introducing them into his history, he would naturally wish to give
some preliminary account of their origin, manners, and institutione,
as he dces in introducing the Jews in the Fiith Book ol his Histories,

which happens ιο be, in part, preserved. Nor would it be strange,

, is he should, with thierlew, collectamass of materiale, which he

could not incorporate entire into a work ol such composa and which
any slight occasion might induce him to publisb in a separato form,
perhaps as a sort of forerunner to his Historiea* Such an occasion
now was furnished in the campaigns and victoriosos Trajan, who,
at the time of his elevaticn ιο the imperial power, was at the head
ol the Roman armies in Germany, where he also remained for a year
or more ulter his accessionto the throne, till he had received the sub·
mission os the hostile tribes aud wiped away the disgrme which the
Germana, beyond any other naticn ol that age, had brought upon
the Roman arms. Such a people‚ at such a time, could not fail to be
an object οι deep interest at Rome This was the time when Taci-
‘tus published his work on Germany3 and such are believed to bave
been the motives and the circumstances, which led ιο the under·

taking. His grand object was not to point a satire or ιο compassa
