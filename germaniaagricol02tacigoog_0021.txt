i amn or sacrans,

Tacitus was edueatcd sor the bar, and continued to plead
causes, occasionally at least, and with not a little success,
aven aliar he had entered upon the great business of hie life,
as a writer of history. We find references to his first, and
perhaps his last appearance, as an advocate, in the letters of
Pliny, which are highly complimentary. The first uras, when
Pliny was nineteen, and Tacitus a little older (how much we
am not informed)‚ when Tacitus distinguished himself, so as
to awalren the emulation and the envy, though not in a bad
sense, of Pliny. The last was some twenty years later, when
Tacitus and Pliny, the tried friends oi a whole lile, the brightest

the choica oi the senate, and pleaded together at the bar of
the Senats, and in the presence os the Emperor Trajan, for
the execution of justice upon Marius Priscus, who was
accused of mal-administration iu the proconsulship of Africa.
Pliny says, that Tacitus spolie with singular gravity and
eloquence‚ and the Senate passed a unanimous vote of appro-
bation and thanks to both the orators, for the ability aud auo·
aeas with which they had managed the prosecution (Plin.
Epis. ii. ll).

We have also the commenta of Pliny ona panegyrical

predecessor in the consular office, Verginius Rufus, perhaps
the most remarkable man of his age, distinguished alike as
ahere, a stateaman, and a scholar, and yet so modest or so
wine that he repeatedly refused the offer of the imperial purple.
'‘Fortuna'' says Pliny, “always faithful tc Verginius, reserved
for her last favor, such an orator to pronounee a eulogium on
anch virtues. It was enough to crown the glory of a well
apem lise'’ (Plin. Epis. ii. 1).
